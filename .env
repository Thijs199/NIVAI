# This .env file is used by docker-compose.
# Variables set here can override those defined in docker-compose.yml or provide
# environment-specific configurations.

# For the current Docker Compose setup, most service-specific environment variables
# are defined directly in the docker-compose.yml file (e.g., service URLs, internal paths).

# The Go backend is configured with CONFIG_PATH=/app/config.json. If this file is
# essential and not auto-generated, its provision needs to be handled, potentially
# by mounting a config file or initializing it.

# Variables from .env.example related to external services (Azure, Database, Redis)
# would be configured here if those services were being connected to by this
# Docker Compose setup. For example:
# DB_HOST=your_db_host
# DB_USER=your_db_user
# DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
# etc.
