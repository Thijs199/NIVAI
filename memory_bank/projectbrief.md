# NIVAI Project Brief

## Project Overview

NIVAI (Netherlands Institute for Video Analysis and Intelligence) is an advanced football tracking data visualization and analysis platform designed for the KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association). The platform enables football analysts, coaches, and teams to upload, process, and analyze match videos and tracking data to gain tactical insights and performance metrics.

## Core Objectives

1. **Video Analysis**: Process and analyze football match videos to extract meaningful data
2. **Real-time Tracking**: Visualize player and ball tracking data synchronized with video footage
3. **Interactive Dashboard**: Provide intuitive dashboards for tactical and performance analysis
4. **Multi-platform Access**: Deliver a responsive web application accessible on various devices
