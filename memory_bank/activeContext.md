# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

The NIVAI project is currently in the Phase 1 (Foundation) stage of development, focusing on implementing the core architecture and essential functionality for the football analytics platform.

### Priority Areas

1. **Backend API Development**

   - Implementing core API endpoints for video and tracking data management
   - Setting up authentication and authorization
   - Creating data models and services
   - Implementing WebSocket support for real-time updates

2. **Frontend Interface Development**

   - Building responsive dashboard layout
   - Developing upload functionality for videos and tracking data
   - Implementing UI components for data visualization
   - Creating page structure and navigation

3. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Creating containerization with Docker
   - Deploying to Kubernetes with proper scaling and security
   - Setting up cloud resources with Terraform
   - Implementing monitoring and logging
