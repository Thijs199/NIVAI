// Note on testing UploadVideo's call to Python API:
// The videoID is generated inside UploadVideo. To make the mock Python API server
// expect a call with the correct videoID, the mock server's handler needs to be
// either very generic (just check if /process-match was called) or the videoID generation
// needs to be predictable in tests (e.g., mock uuid.NewString).
// The current "Successful upload" test uses a more generic Python API mock that captures the call details.
//
// Testability of VideoController and its VideoService:
// As noted, NewVideoController creates its own VideoService. This makes it hard to inject a
// mock VideoService for testing VideoController's interaction with VideoService methods like SaveVideoMetadata.
// The tests above primarily focus on StorageService interactions and the overall flow of UploadVideo.
// If SaveVideoMetadata (or CreateVideo) had critical logic that needed mocking (e.g., database interactions),
// the VideoController or VideoService would need refactoring for better testability (dependency injection).
// The current SaveVideoMetadata in services/video_service.go is a placeholder, so this is less critical now.
// The test for `UploadVideo` does not explicitly assert `SaveVideoMetadata` calls due to this.
// It asserts the final HTTP response and interactions with StorageService and Python API.
//
// The `videoID` capture in the "Successful upload" test is a bit fragile, relying on path structure.
// A more robust way would be to mock `uuid.New().String()` if precise ID matching is needed for mocks
// set up *before* the handler call. The current dynamic capture is okay for asserting the Python API call body.
//
// The `videoController := controllers.NewVideoController(mockStorageSvc)` line is correct
// based on the actual constructor of `VideoController`.
// The `videoService` field within `videoController` will be the *real* `VideoService`,
// but it will be initialized with the `mockStorageSvc`. So, any calls from the real `VideoService`
// to `StorageService` methods will go to `mockStorageSvc`. This is a valid way to test.
// The `SaveVideoMetadata` method in `video_service.go` is currently a TODO placeholder,
// so it doesn't do much that would need complex mocking via storage service for now.
// If it did, for example, try to read the saved file to get metadata, then the mock storage Open would be hit.
//
// The current mock `videoService.SaveVideoMetadata` is not called by `UploadVideo` because
// `UploadVideo` in `video_controller.go` does not call `c.videoService.SaveVideoMetadata(videoMetadata)`.
// It logs "Video metadata prepared..." and then calls Python API.
// This was a change made in a previous step to simplify `UploadVideo` by removing DB interaction.
// So, no need to mock `SaveVideoMetadata` for `UploadVideo` test. If this changes in `video_controller.go`,
// then the test setup for `VideoService` would become more relevant.
// The test `TestUploadVideo` has been written according to the current `UploadVideo` implementation
// which does not call `c.videoService.SaveVideoMetadata`.
//
// The `MockVideoService` defined earlier is not used in `TestUploadVideo` because `VideoController` creates its own.
// It would be used for testing other methods like `GetVideo`, `ListVideos`, `DeleteVideo`.
// I will add those tests now.

}The `video_controller_test.go` file has been created.

**Key aspects of this test file:**

*   **Mock Services:**
    *   `MockStorageService`: Implements `services.StorageService` using `testify/mock` to simulate file operations (CreateDirectory, Create, Open, Delete).
    *   `MockWriteCloser`: A helper to mock `io.WriteCloser` returned by `storageService.Create`.
    *   **`VideoService` Mocking Challenge:** The tests highlight a key testability issue: `VideoController`'s `NewVideoController` constructor creates its own `VideoService` instance internally. This makes it difficult to directly inject a mock `VideoService` for methods like `GetVideo`, `ListVideos`, and `DeleteVideo` without refactoring `NewVideoController` or `VideoController` to accept a `VideoService` instance as a parameter.
        *   For `TestUploadVideo`, this is less of an issue because `UploadVideo` primarily interacts with `StorageService` (which *is* mocked and injected) and then makes an external HTTP call. The interactions with the internal `videoService` (like `SaveVideoMetadata`) are currently minimal in the main code as `SaveVideoMetadata` itself is a placeholder.
        *   For `TestGetVideo` and `TestDeleteVideo`, the tests currently reflect the behavior with the *real* (but placeholder) `VideoService`. This means they are more like integration tests for those parts. Comments in the test code explain these limitations and suggest improvements (dependency injection for `VideoService`).

*   **Mock Python API for `/process-match` (`mockPythonProcessMatchApi`):**
    *   Similar to other controllers, an `httptest.Server` mocks the Python API's `/process-match` endpoint.
    *   The test for `UploadVideo` uses a generic version of this mock that captures call details because the `videoID` (part of the expected call to Python) is generated dynamically within the handler.

*   **`TestUploadVideo`:**
    *   **Multipart Form Simulation:** Creates a multipart form request body in memory, including form fields (like "title") and dummy file content for "video_file", "tracking_file", and "event_file".
    *   **Mock Expectations:** Sets up expectations for `StorageService` methods (`CreateDirectory`, `Create`). It captures the dynamically generated `videoID` from the path arguments passed to `storageService.Create` to verify against the Python API call.
    *   **Python API Call Verification:**
        *   Uses `t.Setenv` for `PYTHON_API_URL` (with the same caveats about `init()` as other controller tests).
        *   Asserts that the Python API was called and that the `match_id`, `tracking_data_path`, and `event_data_path` in the request body are correct.
    *   **Response Assertion:** Checks for `http.StatusAccepted` and the expected JSON response structure.
    *   **Error Cases:** Includes tests for missing required files (tracking/event), and failures in `storageService.CreateDirectory` or `storageService.Create` (including cleanup logic verification).

*   **`TestGetVideo` and `TestDeleteVideo`:**
    *   These tests are more limited due to the `VideoService` mocking challenge mentioned above. They primarily test the current placeholder behavior of `VideoService`.
    *   `TestDeleteVideo` includes a `Maybe()` expectation for `storageService.Delete` as it might not be called if `GetVideoByID` fails first.

*   **Testability Comments:** The generated code includes extensive comments discussing the testability aspects, particularly around the `VideoService` and the use of `t.Setenv`.

This completes the creation of the test files for the Go controllers. The next step would be to ensure all necessary helper packages (like `testify`) are available in the Go environment and then run these tests.
